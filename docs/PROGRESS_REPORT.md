## Overview

This tool provides automated evaluation of GitHub repositories against Euro-Argo Software Guidelines. It combines automated API checks with manual assessment to generate compliance scores and actionable recommendations.

### Evaluation Workflow

1. User submits GitHub repository URL
2. System performs automated checks via GitHub API
3. User completes interactive questionnaire 
4. System calculates compliance score and assigns badge level (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
5. Tool generates detailed improvement recommendations
